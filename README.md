# Classification-of-movement-data

There are four different movement data:
1)right arm  
2)right thumb
3)right leg
4)no movement

The EEG signals of 15 healthy right-handed people (5 women and 10 men) with an average age of 31 years were recorded. A 64-channel signal recording system with a sampling frequency of 2400 Hz has been used, and the city electricity removal filter was active during data recording.The ground of the signal acquisition system was connected to the forehead and one of the channels as a reference channel was connected to the right ear (which was removed from the data set and therefore there are 63 data channels).The signal of all electrodes is filtered with a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz. The arrangement of the electrodes according to their names and row numbers in the data matrix is shown in the following figures.<img width="655" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-05 at 10 07 53 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69970956/210717254-2fced4da-60b9-4630-a6e9-6afc35152d0b.png">
