# Classification-of-movement-data

The EEG signals of 15 healthy right-handed people (5 women and 10 men) with an average age of 31 years were recorded. A 64-channel signal recording system with a sampling frequency of 2400 Hz has been used, and the city electricity removal filter was active during data recording.The ground of the signal acquisition system was connected to the forehead and one of the channels as a reference channel was connected to the right ear (which was removed from the data set and therefore there are 63 data channels).The signal of all electrodes is filtered with a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz. The arrangement of the electrodes according to their names and row numbers in the data matrix is shown in the following figures.

Test protocol:
The subject is sitting on a comfortable chair and the screen is located in front of him at a distance of half a meter. The task that the subject must perform during the test is doing movement. The target organs are right thumb, right foot and right arm. The test protocol is shown in figure below:

First, the + sign is shown in the center of the screen for 2 seconds; during this time, one should not think about anything
and be ready to view the cue.
In the next 2 seconds, the desired sign will appear; Three types of signs are used in this protocol, which show the execution of the movements of the mentioned organs to the subject. After 2 seconds, the sign disappears and the word "Go" will appear for 0.5 seconds and the subject will have 3 seconds from the moment of seeing "Go" to perform the desired task.v
